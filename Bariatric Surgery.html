                Bariatric surgery is a medical procedure performed on individuals who are severely overweight or obese,
                with the goal of promoting weight loss and addressing related health issues. This type of surgery
                involves altering the digestive system to limit the amount of food a person can eat and, in some cases,
                reducing the absorption of nutrients.

            <h3 class="head3"> There are different types of bariatric surgery, but the most common ones include:</h3>

            <h4 class="head4">Gastric Bypass:</h4> In this procedure, a small pouch is created at the top of the stomach
            and connected directly to the small intestine. This limits the amount of food that can be consumed and
            reduces the absorption of nutrients by bypassing a portion of the stomach and small intestine.

            <h4 class="head4"> Sleeve Gastrectomy:</h4> This involves removing a large portion of the stomach, leaving a
            smaller, banana-shaped "sleeve" that restricts the amount of food that can be eaten. It also reduces the
            production of hunger-stimulating hormones.

            <h4 class="head4">Adjustable Gastric Banding:</h4> A band is placed around the upper part of the stomach,
            creating a smaller pouch. The band can be adjusted to control the size of the opening between the pouch and
            the rest of the stomach.

            <h4 class="head4">Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS):</h4> This procedure involves
            removing a portion of the stomach and rerouting the small intestine to reduce the absorption of calories and
            nutrients. <br> <br>

            Bariatric surgery is considered a last resort for individuals who have tried other weight loss methods
            without success and are at high risk for obesity-related health issues such as diabetes, heart disease, or
            sleep apnea. It is essential to note that bariatric surgery is not a quick fix and requires significant
            lifestyle changes, including a healthy diet and regular exercise, to achieve long-term success.
            Additionally, candidates for bariatric surgery typically undergo thorough evaluations and assessments before
            the procedure to ensure they are suitable candidates and understand the potential risks and benefits.
